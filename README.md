# Haiti_Disaster_Relief_Project
This analysis was done in order to find blue tarps via machine learning using spectral analysis. 
When the Haiti disaster occured FEMA handed out supplies one of which being blue tarps that were to be used as shelter. 
The issue of how they were going to find the citizens of Haiti to distribute further supplies soon arose. 
Images were captured by planes flying over which provided us with RGB codes that we could in turn use to identify coordinates of where these citizes would be.
